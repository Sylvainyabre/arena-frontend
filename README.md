This project is an online learning platform that I designed and programmed  during the summer of 2021 using the MERN stack.
The home page displays courses the user can explore, to see the content of a course a user must be logged in and must enrol in that specific course to see all the modules.
An instructor can can create, edit or delete courses while a basic user can only read the content of a course.
The course creation form has rich text editor, namely CKeditor 5, it allows image upload, link insertion, youtube embedding and many more. The website is entirely mobile responsive.
The backend using JSON web token as an auth system.
The deployed project can be viewed here: https://brain-arena.netlify.app/
